Repository for a data analysis and visualization project investigating environmental exposures and their interaction with racial and ethnic demographics in the Bay Area. 

This project was created in partnership with fellow MCB grad student Izaiah Ornelas for our course on Communicating Quantitative Information (MCBc277).

Data source: [CalEnviroScreen4.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40) from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
